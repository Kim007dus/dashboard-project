Project: Admin Dashboard for The Odin Project - Intermediate HTML & CSS Course

I started this project while doing a bootcamp full stack development to practice my Grid and Flexbox skills. 
I used the design from The Odin Project (https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png) as a reference.
